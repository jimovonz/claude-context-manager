Focus on preserving:
- Current task context and objectives
- Key decisions made and their rationale
- Important file paths and code locations discovered
- Any pending actions or TODOs
- Error messages and debugging context being investigated
- Critical state (connections, configurations, credentials referenced)

Summarize completed work concisely. Prioritize actionable context over historical details.
Maintain enough context to continue the current task without re-reading files.
